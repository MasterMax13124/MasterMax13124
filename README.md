# Hi there, I'm Max!

I am a Business Informatics student and Linux/Unix fan from Germany. On my profile you will mainly find repos with small pieces of software I wrote for my personal use, but some of it might be useful for you too. You can find some of the highlights in my pinned repositories, including [macytclip](https://github.com/MasterMax13124/macytclip), a simple macOS menubar widget for accessing youtube-dl, [instafetch](https://github.com/MasterMax13124/instafetch), a fun little script that adds Instagram images to your neofetch output, my [dotfiles](https://github.com/MasterMax13124/dotfiles) of course, for Arch Linux and Mac, and finally a shell script I've been working on called [dfm](https://github.com/MasterMax13124/dfm) that can be used to easily manage your dotfiles.

### My set-up:
- 🐧 **Operating systems:** macOS Big Sur, Arch Linux, sometimes Windows 10
- 💻 **Computers:** MacBook Air M1, Thinkpad X260, custom built desktop (with gaming focus)
- 🔧 **Linux/Unix tools:** kitty terminal, dwm, neovim, firefox

### Other things I like:
- 🎵 Lots of different music genres, from 70s Japenese jazz to 2010s progressive metal
- 🎮 Video games of course, Dark Souls 1 and Dishonored 2 are my favorites
- 🏓 Playing some table tennis every now and again
